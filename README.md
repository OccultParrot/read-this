## Description
            
Hate writing READMEss? Well me too! In order to fix that problem I have written this console application in order to stream line the process!

## License

## Installation
            
If you do not have Node.js installed, install that first! Once installed, click the "Code" button on the left and click "Download .Zip". Extract everything in that .zip file and you are ready to use it!

## Usage
            
Navagate to the directory that holds the files from the .zip file. Once there, simpily type `npm start` and the program will start asking you questions! After answering them all, look in the output folder and you will see your READMEs file! \*BEWARE The program will rewrite any read me files in the output directory!\*
